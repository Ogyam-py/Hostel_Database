# Hostel_Database
Given a database of occupants of a hostel in a text file formate I tasked myself to sort them outand create a databse for the data.
My algorithm focused on parsing the text data and create an SQLite database.
The resulting database had additional infomation such as the floor of every occupant, their block ID and their roommates.
The database was organized and easier to query when locating an individual or a section of the population.
