# Hostel_Database
Given a database of occupants of the KNUST Brunei Hostel. I combined my knowledge of python and SQL to read the file.
My algorithm was tasked to parse the data and create an SQLite database.
The database was organized and was easier to query when locating an individual or a section of the population.
